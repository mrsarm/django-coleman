Django Coleman
==============

Django Coleman: A very simple Task Management web app written
with **Django Admin**.


Features
--------

* Simple task manager that allows to define a tasks with title,
  partner (customer, provider...), description, responsible of the task, priority...
* Each task may have items: sub-tasks to be done.
* The built-in Django *Authentication and Authorization* system
  to manage users and groups, login, etc.
* Module `django-adminfilters <https://github.com/mrsarm/django-adminfilters>`_
  that allows multiselection searches.
* Send emails when a task is created.
* Spanish translations.
* Basic Rest API configuration (disabled by default, check the
  ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting).
* Optionally, you can use Django Coleman along with
  `Django Coleman Viewer <https://github.com/mrsarm/tornado-dcoleman-mtasks-viewer>`_
  to allows users to follow the orders.
* Pytest with some tests as example and code coverage reports configured.
* Docker and Docker Compose configurations (images published in
  `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/mrsarm/django-coleman>`_).
* Ready to use "production" configurations as reference.

Requirements
------------

Docker, or:

* Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.8, and 3.10).
* Django 3.2 LTS and other dependencies declared in
  the ``requirements.txt`` file (use virtual environments or containers!).
* A Django compatible database like PostgreSQL (by default uses
  the Python's built-in SQLite database for development purpose).


Install and Run
---------------

Using Docker, check the section below. Otherwise:

Create a virtual environment and activate it with *(Optional)*::

    $ python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies with::

    $ pip install --upgrade pip wheel
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the database with::

    $ python3 manage.py migrate

You should run first the ``makemigrations`` task if changes in the model were made.

To create an admin user::

    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Then run in development mode with::

    $ python3 manage.py runserver

Add at the end ``0:5000`` if you want to open the port 5000
instead of the default 8000, and the ``0:`` prefix is to
let Django accepts connection outside localhost (optional).

Or use the following script to startup in "production" mode,
with a uWSGI server::

    $ uwsgi uwsgi.ini


Procfile and Honcho
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project also include a `<Procfile>`_, ready to use
in platforms that support it like Heroku, or with
command line tools like `Honcho <https://honcho.readthedocs.io>`_
or Foreman.

Honcho has the advantage of loading the environment variables
from an .env file automatically (see section below). To install
it execute ``pip3 install honcho``. Once installed, to run
the app with Honcho::

    $ honcho start web

There are other shortcuts in the Procfile, like a command to
create both the user and database (you have to provide the
"master" password from the user "postgres" in an env variable)::

    $  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres honcho start createdb

And here is the command to automatically creates an "admin" user
with password "admin1234"::

    $ honcho start createadmin


Docker
------

A reference `<Dockerfile>`_ is provided, and the image published
in `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/mrsarm/django-coleman>`_.

Also `<docker-compose.yml>`_ and `<.env.example>`_ files are provided, you can run
all from here, Django Coleman, the viewer app and Postgres.

First, copy the ``.env.example`` file as ``.env`` file, and edit whatever
value you want to::

    $ cp .env.example .env

Then before run for the first time the containers, you have to either
download the images from Docker Hub or build them from the source code. To
build the images from the source code, execute::

    $ docker-compose build

Or to get the images from Docker Hub, execute::

    $ docker-compose pull

Once the images are installed in your local machine, create the containers
and run all of them with::

    $ docker-compose up

The first time it runs some errors about the DB are shown, that's because
you need to create the DB and the structure (tables, indexes), all can
be created in another terminal executing::

    $ docker-compose run django-coleman-provision

Even a user ``admin`` with password ``admin1234`` is created.

Access the apps and the DB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The URL to access the app is the same than running it with
Python locally: http://localhost:8000/admin/ .

Once created an order, if the id is ``1``, it can be viewed
by the viewer with http://localhost:8888/1?t=porgs .

If you want to then open a `psql` session for the DB from the
containers: ``docker-compose run psql``.

Local persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default a local volume ``django-coleman_data`` is attached
to the Postgres container so even executing ``docker-compose down``
won't delete the data, but if you want to start from scratch::

    $ docker-compose down
    $ docker volume rm pg-coleman_data

Add changes in the code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When adding changes in the code, the image needs to be updated::

    $ docker-compose build

Then run again. A script ``docker-build.sh`` with more advance
features and without using docker-compose is also provided
to re-build the image.


Settings
--------

Most settings can be overwritten with environment variables.
For example to overwrite the language translations of the application and
set *debug* options to false::

    $ DEBUG=False LANGUAGE_CODE=es-ar python3 manage.py runserver

Also in development environments an ``.env`` file can be used to setup
the environment variables easily, checkout the `<.env.example>`_ as example.
You can copy the example file and edit the variables you want to change::

   $ cp .env.example .env
   $ vi .env

Some available settings:

* ``DEBUG``: set the Django ``DEBUG`` option. Default ``True``.
* ``TIME_ZONE``: default ``UTC``. Other example: ``America/Buenos_Aires``.
* ``LANGUAGE_CODE``: default ``en-us``. Other example: ``es-ar``.
* ``SITE_HEADER``: Header title of the app. Default to *"Django Coleman - A Simple Task Manager"*.
* ``DATABASE_URL``: Database string connection. Default uses SQLite database. Other
  example: ``postgresql://dcoleman:postgres@localhost/dcoleman_dev``.
* More settings like email notifications, check the ``settings.py`` file
  for more details, any variable that is set with ``env('...`` is able
  to be configured using environment variables.

To run in a production environment, check the `<README-production.rst>`_ notes, or
see the official Django documentation.


Access the application
----------------------

Like any Django app developed with Django Admin, enter with: http://localhost:8000/admin


Tests
-----

Tests run with Pytest::

    $ pytest

Or use the Honcho task that also generates a report with
the tests coverage: ``honcho start --no-prefix test``.


Django Coleman Viewer
---------------------

`Django Coleman Viewer <https://github.com/mrsarm/tornado-dcoleman-mtasks-viewer>`_ is a
small webapp that can be used along with Django Coleman to allow "partners" (customers, employees,
providers...) to see their orders anonymously, without access to the Django Admin.

You need to enable the email notifications and set ``TASKS_VIEWER_ENABLED`` and ``REST_ENABLED``
settings to ``True`` to send the emails with the viewer order URL. See more configurations in the
``coleman/settings_emails.py`` file, and checkout the viewer project.

Development
-----------

Some tips if you are improving this application.

Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

After add to the source code new texts to be translated, in the command
line go to the module folder where the translations were edited, e.g.
the "mtasks" folder, and execute the following replacing ``LANG``
by a valid language code like ``es``::

    $ django-admin makemessages -l LANG

Then go to the *.po* file and add the translations. In the
case of the "mtasks" module with ``es`` language, the file is
located at ``mtasks/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po``. Finally
execute the following to compile the locales::

    $ django-admin compilemessages


Oldest Django versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``master`` branch works with Django 3.2 LTS. The are a few more branches (though unmaintained):

* ``django/2.2``
* ``django/2.0``
* ``django/1.11``

With the source code that works for each version of Django,
and maybe tweaking some configurations can works with older versions too.
